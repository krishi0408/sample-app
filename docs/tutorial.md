In this tutorial you will learn how you can seamlessly get started with Harness CI for ```Python```. In this pipeline we will be implementing an Hello World Server in ```Python```.

### Step 1: Create your Harness Project

- Move to the Harness Platform & click on Project -> New Project
- Configure the project settings as below

  ```Name: (Default Project Name)```


  ```Organization: Default```

- Select CI Module in the modules sections


### Step 2: Pipeline Creation & Configure Stages

- Click on ```Pipelines``` -> Create a Pipeline 
- Configure the pipeline as below

  ```Name: CI-Python-Quickstart```

  ```Set up pipeline as: Inline```


To know more about Pipelines [check out the docs here](overview.md)

### Build Step

- Click on ```Add Stage``` to get started with the pipeline creation
- Select the type of stage as ```Build```
- Configure the Stage Settings as below

```Name: build test and run```

**Setup the Connector as follows**

Select ```Connectors``` -> Click on ```+ New Connector```

Connector Type: ```Github```

Name: ```python-sample-connector ```

URL Type : ```Repository```

Connection Type: ```HTTP```

GitHub Repository URL: Paste the link of your forked repository

Username: (Your Github Username)

Personal Access Token: [Check out how to create personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Secret Name: ```Git-Token```

Secret  Value: PAT value generated in Github

Click on Save 

This will allow the repository to be fetched click on it and click ```Apply Selected```

Make Enable API access (ON) with the secret token created

Click on Connect through Harness Delegate. [Check out more on Harness Delegate](https://docs.harness.io/article/sjjik49xww-kubernetes-cluster-connector-settings-reference)

To develop more understanding on Connectors [check out the docs here](overview.md)

Then go to Execution (In this step we are going to compile the code)
#### Code Compilation

- Click on ```Add step``` 
 - Go to ```Build``` and click on ```Run```
 - Change the settings as following 
 - Name: ```Code compile```
 - Container Registry -> Choose ```New connector```
   - Click on ```Docker Registry```
   - Change the settings as following 
       - Overview 
         - Name- ```docker quickstart```
       - Details 
         - Docker registry url -  ```https://index.docker.io/v1/```
         - Provider type - ```Docker Hub``` 
         - Authentication - ```Username and Password```
         - Username - Docker hub username 
         - Secret Token - [Check out how to create docker PAT](Secret.md)
       - Connect to Provider 
         - Choose connect through harness delegate -> Select Harness delegate you created 
       - It will take sometime to verify your credentials.
  - Image:```python:3.10.6-alpine```
  - Shell: ```Sh```
  - Command:
 
    ```python3 -m venv venv```
   
    ```python -m compileall ./```
  - Then click ```Apply changes``` 
 
 ####  Image Creation  
 
 - Click on ```Add step```
   - Go to builds and click on run 
   - Change the settings as following:
   
      - Name: ```create image``` 
      - Container registry: Click on docker connecter created in the previous step 
      - Image: ```alpine```
      - Commands: Copy the following command and click on apply changes.
 
         ```
         touch pythondockerfile
         cat > pythondockerfile <<- EOM
         FROM python:3.10.6-alpine
         WORKDIR /py-sample-proj
         ADD . /py-sample-proj
         RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
         CMD ["python" , "app.py"]
         EOM
         cat pythondockerfile
         ```
         
      
 #### Build and Push Image to Docker Registry
 - Click on ```Add step```
 - Go to ```builds``` and click on ```build and push an image to docker registry```
 -  Change the settings as following:
    - Name: ```Build and push image to docker hub```
    - Docker connector: select the Docker connector you created previously 
    - Docker repository: ```<docker-hub-username>/<docker-repository name>```
    - Tags: ```latest```

### Integeration Testing 

Now you have a Stage to clone, build, containerize, and then push your image to Docker Hub. In this step you'll add a Stage to pull that image, run it       in a container, and run integration tests on it.

- Click Add stage and select ```build```
- Name it as ```integration test``` 
- Turn off ```clone from codebase``` 
- Click ```setup stage``` 
  - Go to the ```Stage overview``` turn on ```Clone Codebase```

    - Now we will setup Stage Infrastructure
      - Go to Infrastructure and select propagate from an existing stage.
        - Select the previous stage
        - Click ```Next```
In the Build Test and Push stage, you built your code and pushed your built image to Docker Hub.
Harness will pull the image onto the container in your infrastructure. Next, it will start the Hello World Server in the image.

   - Go to execution tab in run integration stage 
       - Select ```add step``` 
         -  Go to builds and select background 
       - Change the settings as following 
          - Name: ```python server``` 
          - Description(optional): ```server connection```
          - Container registry: select the Docker connector you created previously
          - Shell: ```Sh```
          - Select ```Apply changes``` 
#### Connecting to server
Next, we can run an integration test. We'll simply test the connection to the server.
    - Select add step in the execution tab of run integration stage 
    - Go to Builds and select Run 
    - Change the settings as following 
      - Name: ```test connection to server``` 
      - Container registry: select Docker connector you created .
      - Image: ```curlimages/curl:7.73.0```
      - Commands:
         ```
         sleep 10
         curl localhost:5000
         ```
