# Python Sample Pipelines in Harness

Introduction
========================
This repository is a home for snippets of YAML code and a sample hello world server of scripting for the Harness CI Community.

## Getting Started

Use this README to get started with our sample pipeline repository for Python. This guide outlines the basics of getting started with the Harness CI and provides a full code sample for you to try out. This sample doesnâ€™t include configuration options, for in depth steps and configuring the pipeline for example using triggers or using our templates see the Pipeline Configuration Docs.

Here we have build a simple two-stage CI Pipeline in Harness. Setting up and running the Pipeline will take about 30 minutes. The Pipeline will build and run a unit test on a sample nodejs repository upload the artifact to Docker Hub and then run integration tests. You can use publicly-available code, images, and your Github and Docker Hub accounts.

## Workflow
- Use a Kubernetes cluster build farm.
- Build the code and run unit tests in the build farm.
- Package the app as a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub.
- Pull the uploaded image to the build farm as a Background Task. Check out more about background tasks here
- Run an integration test against the sample app.
